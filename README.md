# Fabric Modding for Beginners (WIP)

## About
This is a tutorial on how you can start making fabric mods for Minecraft with little to no experience. The aim of this tutorial is not to merely provide documentation and descriptions, but also to provide explanations for people who may not understand it. Things are explained with simple language and it is easy to understand. 
I am also not too experienced with modding, so some explainations may be inaccurate. Please correct them if you can see any. 

## Introduction
### What is a Minecraft mod?
A mod is a program that can modify the behavior of a game. In Minecraft, mods can add new items, blocks, mobs, user interfaces and entirely new mechanics. Since Minecraft does not support mods by default, mods rely on third-party mod loaders. The most popular ones are Forge and Fabric. There is also server software such as Bukkit and Spigot which supports "plugins" which allow serverside modification.
